        <h2>Heres why: Unjust wages and working conditions is an injustice that is widely known in our economy. 
            The working class can be faced with unjust pay. 
            This includes being paid less than someone at the same position as you for many reasons such as for their race or religion. 
            In the fashion economy, workers can be paid less due to the price of the item. There are also unjust working conditions. 
            Factories like sweatshops pay workers a low wage and they work in dangerous conditions. 
            Poor working conditions  and low wages can affect the health of a worker and their family.
